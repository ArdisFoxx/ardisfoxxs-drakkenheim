Fan made module to support running of Dungeons of Drakkenheim in Pathfinder 2e and Daggerheart.

Includes Actors and Items for playing Drakkenheim campaigns in PF2e and Daggerheart (in development), as well as Scenes, Journals, Macros, Rolltables, Music and Sound Effects to enhance your Drakkenheim campaign into a premium experience.

---------------

Note that this module relies on certain premium Drakkenheim content from Ghostfire Gaming and 3rd party content from Epic Isometric to fully function. Email me at ardisfoxxart@gmail.com with your purchase receipt of the Drakkenheim PDF and the Epic Isometric Patreon and I can supply you with a MEGA folder containing the additional assets required for this Foundry module. 

For full functionality I also recommend picking up the Simple Quest and Macro Wheel modules from TheRipper93's Patreon - just subscribe for a month then download the modules you want and cancel your sub if you don't want to continue supporting. I promise that those modules are worth it.

-----------------

The whole landing page is interactive.

* Clicking the gold bag opens the party loot vault
* Clicking the candle opens the Sacred Flame lore page
* Clicking the player cards open the player's personal journals
* Clicking the astrolabe opens lore about delerium and the haze. These feature homebrew changes to contamination that make contamination usable in both PF2e and 5e
* Clicking the maps opens them in an image view
* The faction reputation sliders are all tiles that can be moved around, showing the PCs reputation with factions from nemesis > enemy > neutral > ally > champion
* Diablo II sound effects on all the tile triggers

-----------------

//Installation Instructions//

Go to your compendiums and search for "AFD". Import the Landing Page scene folder, as well as all Journals, Macros and Roll Tables. The remaining Actors, Items, and Scenes, you can just leave in the compendiums and import them individually as needed (the less you import, the smoother your Foundry will run).
-----------------

//Customize It For Your Campaign//

That the PSD file for the Landing Page scene is included in the "ardisfoxxs-drakkenheim/assets/UI" folder. Open this .psd file in Clipstudio Paint, Photoshop or whatever PSD editor you have access to (there are many free apps that can edit PSD files. I recommend https://www.photopea.com/ as its a free opensource online app that doesn't require installation). Using the Drakkenheim_Landing_Page.psd, replace the PC images with pics of your campaign's PCs. Export the file in JPEG format and save over Drakkenheim-Landing-Page-v2.jpg and Drakkenheim-Landing-Page-v2.1.jpg files in the "Drakkenheim UI Assets\Landing Page" folder.

Monk's Active Tile Triggers makes tiles clickable buttons. Edit the active tile links by double-clicking a tile > Triggers > Actions. Change the Card journals to link to a different player journal instead of the ones I included from my own campaign.

Drag any macros that you want to use into your hotbar. These reference the included roll tables.

Check out the Drakkenheim Journals I included. I've added every quest in the Drakkenheim book, and these are linked to the Factions journals too. Using Monk's Enhanced Journals, players can see any quests that you've flagged as active.
Some example quests are active so you will want to deactivate those so your players can't see them. Go to the Journal Notes button on the left sidebar and click the Toggle Objectives button to show Quests. You can then double-click any of those quests on the popup window and uncheck "Show to Players" to remove player permissions over it and "Display in Notifications" to remove it from the Quests popup window.

The Faction Reputation Sliders on the landing page are all tiles, showing PC's relationship with the factions, from Nemesis > Enemy > Neutral > Ally > Champion. Included in the Drakkenheim UI Assets folder are slider tile images for Enemy/Neutral/Ally in red/grey/blue colours respectively. 

Note that the "ardisfoxxs-drakkenheim/assets/UI" folder also includes "Old" assets used in my previous module "Drakkenheim Landing Menu". I've left these in there in case they might be useful for you - some of them are used for this new module.

-----------------

* The Landing Page module previously required Lock View version 1.5.5 and Isometric Perspective module, but the latest versions of Landing Page use Foundry v13 and these other modules are not compatible, so the updated scenes have been configured not to use them.
